# RIA Management System - Comprehensive Development Plan

*Generated: 2025-09-11*

## Executive Summary

This development plan outlines the systematic approach to building the RIA Management System as specified in the Management System App.md document. The plan maps the current implementation status against the target architecture and provides a phased roadmap for completion.

## Current State Analysis

### Already Implemented
1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Multi-tenant Prisma database schema with PostgreSQL
   - Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript
   - NestJS API backend (basic setup)
   - Zustand state management with repositories pattern
   - Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui component library foundation
   - Authentication system with NextAuth (sign-in/sign-up pages)
   - EntityLink system for cross-module relationships

2. **Modules (Partial Implementation)**
   - **Portal**: Basic layout with navigation dock
   - **Tasks**: List, board, calendar views with saved views system
   - **Library**: Wiki documents, uploads with folder structure, learning resources
   - **Finance**: Basic invoices page structure

### Gap Analysis vs Target Architecture

#### Major Gaps
1. **Portal Dashboard**: No widget system, no drag-and-drop grid, no customization
2. **Inventory & Manufacturing**: Completely missing (critical for core business)
3. **Finance**: No double-entry ledger, no chart of accounts, no financial reports
4. **Store/Storefront**: Missing public-facing e-commerce
5. **Maps & Field Ops**: Not implemented
6. **Admin Panel**: Basic settings only, no RBAC, no audit logs
7. **Real-time Features**: No WebSocket/real-time updates
8. **Search**: No global search, no command palette integration
9. **Data Integrations**: No cross-module data flows

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
1. **Clean Architecture**: Repository → Store → Component pattern
2. **Module Isolation**: No direct imports between modules
3. **Type Safety**: No `any` types, proper interfaces everywhere
4. **Error Handling**: Error boundaries on all pages
5. **Performance**: Code splitting, virtualization, optimistic updates

### Development Standards
1. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for business logic (>80% coverage)
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for critical flows
   - Component tests with Storybook

2. **Code Organization**
   ```
   apps/
     web/           → Pages only, no business logic
     api/           → Controllers only
   packages/
     [module]-server/  → Business logic
     web-ui/          → ALL UI components
     db/              → Schema and migrations
     client/          → Repositories and stores
   ```

3. **Security Checklist**
   - [ ] Validate tenantId in all queries
   - [ ] Check permissions before operations
   - [ ] Sanitize user input
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting
   - [ ] Audit sensitive operations

### Performance Targets
- Initial page load: <3s on 3G
- Time to interactive: <5s
- API response time: <200ms p50, <1s p99
- List virtualization for >100 items
- Offline capability for critical features

### Data Integrity Requirements
1. **Financial Accuracy**
   - Balance sheet must always balance
   - Total debits = Total credits
   - Immutable audit trail
   - Automated integrity checks

2. **Inventory Accuracy**
   - Real-time stock levels
   - Movement audit trail
   - Cycle count variances
   - Location tracking

3. **Multi-tenancy**
   - Complete data isolation
   - No cross-tenant queries
   - Tenant-scoped indexes
   - Row-level security

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Performance**
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, query optimization, caching layer
   
2. **Real-time Scalability**
   - Mitigation: WebSocket connection pooling, event batching
   
3. **Financial Compliance**
   - Mitigation: Automated testing, external audit, immutable ledger

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict phase gates, feature flags, MVP focus
   
2. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Mock implementations first, gradual integration
   
3. **Data Migration**
   - Mitigation: Versioned schemas, reversible migrations, staging tests

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a structured approach to building the complete RIA Management System. The phased approach allows for incremental delivery of value while maintaining architectural integrity. Each phase builds upon the previous, ensuring a stable foundation for future enhancements.

The plan prioritizes:
1. **Core infrastructure** and security
2. **User-facing value** through the Portal
3. **Business-critical features** (Inventory, Finance)
4. **Differentiating capabilities** (Maps, Incident Mode)

Success depends on maintaining discipline around the clean architecture pattern, comprehensive testing, and regular validation against the target specifications in Management System App.md.
