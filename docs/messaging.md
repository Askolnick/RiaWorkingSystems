# Messaging Centre

The messaging centre provides a unified inbox for all your communications,
including emails, in‑app chat, client portal messages and social media
integrations.  Messages can be filtered, prioritised and converted into
tasks or linked to invoices, bugs or wiki pages.  Real‑time chat and
asynchronous emails share a consistent interface so you can stay on top
of your conversations.
