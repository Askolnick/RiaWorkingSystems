# Insights Centre

The insights centre aggregates metrics and analytics across all modules.
Dashboards display KPIs such as revenue, expenses, open tasks, project
velocity, campaign performance and product adoption.  Users can filter
and drill down into charts, export data to CSV or PDF and create
customised reports using both structured data and AIâ€‘driven queries.
