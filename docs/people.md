# People & Groups

People (users) belong to organisations through `Membership` records.
Each membership holds a role (e.g. admin, member, client) and may be
assigned to one or more **groups**.  Groups are used for access
control when publishing documents (see the publication model) and for
targeting campaigns.  People can also be tagged with arbitrary
attributes (e.g. engineer, designer, manager) to build dynamic
audiences and personalised experiences.
