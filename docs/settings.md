# Settings Centre

The settings centre lets users customise the look and feel of the
application and manage their personal preferences.  Themes can be
selected (light/dark plus custom colour schemes), and background
images or patterns can be set.  Users control notifications, keyboard
shortcuts, language and locale, and other preferences.  Organisations
can also set workspace branding, default templates and feature
toggles.
