# Campaigns Centre

The campaigns centre serves as your marketing automation hub.  Build
email or multi‑channel campaigns, segment audiences based on CRM data
and track opens, clicks and conversions in real time.  A rich editor
supports AI‑assisted content generation and code previews via MJML or
React Email.  Campaigns integrate with finance to send invoice
reminders and with product releases to announce new features.
