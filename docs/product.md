# Product Centre

The product centre lets you define and manage your products and
services.  It includes features for tracking feature requests,
roadmaps, version histories and release notes.  Feedback collected from
clients and internal teams can be voted on (with weighted expert
votes) to prioritise what to build next.  The centre integrates with
tasks and campaigns so releases automatically generate tasks and
announcements.
