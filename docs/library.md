# Library Centre

The library is a central repository for all your organisation’s assets:
contacts, suppliers, resources, products and documents.  Documents
(including wikis and sections) can be tagged, filtered and grouped
visually to help you organise knowledge.  The library supports
drag‑and‑drop organisation and real‑time collaboration for editing
content.  It also stores receipts, statements and other financial
documents that can be linked to expenses or invoices.
