# Admin Centre

The admin centre provides tools for managing your organisation’s
configuration.  Define roles and permissions, manage tenants and
subscriptions, configure integrations (Figma, Onshape, Git, Slack,
email providers) and access audit logs.  This centre also houses
security settings, retention policies and other organisation‑wide
controls.
