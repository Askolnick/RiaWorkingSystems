# AI‑Assisted Accounting and Balance Sheets

This document outlines the design for an **AI‑assisted accounting system** within Ria Living Systems.  The goal is to reduce manual bookkeeping effort by automatically classifying transactions, generating balanced journal entries and producing real‑time financial statements.

## Why Automate Accounting?

Traditional bookkeeping is repetitive and error‑prone.  Modern AI models can process financial data precisely and reduce errors while improving efficiency【892176557464615†L125-L160】.  When integrated into an ERP, automation can handle up to 80 percent of accounting tasks and provide real‑time insights into revenue, expenses and cash flow【892176557464615†L160-L173】.

Key benefits of AI assistance include:

- **High accuracy**: machine‑learning models trained on your data can classify vendors, expenses and tax codes with high confidence【892176557464615†L125-L160】.
- **Real‑time updates**: journal entries are posted immediately after bank transactions or invoices arrive, enabling up‑to‑date balance sheets and profit & loss statements【892176557464615†L160-L173】.
- **Reduced manual work**: routine postings, reconciliations and accruals are handled by the system, freeing accountants to focus on exceptions and analysis.
- **Explainability**: each AI posting stores a rationale, confidence score and the source prompt/response for audit purposes.

## Architecture Overview

The finance module augments the core data model with additional tables for **bills, payments, accounts and journal entries**, plus AI‑specific models for posting policies, suggestions and prompt logs.  A rules engine covers common patterns (e.g. recurring taxi fares).  When rules do not apply, an AI model (e.g. DeepSeek) proposes a balanced entry with a confidence score.  High‑confidence suggestions are automatically posted; the rest go to a review queue.

### Data Models

- `Account` and `AccountType` define a simple chart of accounts covering assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.  Accounts can be nested via a `parentId` relationship.
- `JournalEntry` and `JournalLine` record debit/credit lines for every accounting event.  All transactions – invoices, bill payments, expenses – ultimately post to the journal.
- `PostingPolicy` stores deterministic rules (pattern → result) for frequent transactions.
- `AISuggestion` captures proposed journal entries from the AI engine along with confidence, rationale and outcome (accepted, rejected).
- `BankLineLink` records reconciliations between imported bank transactions and your invoices/bills/expenses.
- `PromptLog` stores the prompts and responses sent to the AI model for audit and cost analysis.

### Posting Flow

1. **Ingest**: a new invoice, bill, expense or bank line arrives.
2. **Rules engine**: the system evaluates deterministic `PostingPolicy` rules.  If a match is found, a journal entry is posted immediately.
3. **AI suggestion**: if no rule matches, the system sends the normalised event data, chart of accounts and tax rules to the AI model.  The model proposes a set of debit/credit lines, a confidence score and an explanation.
4. **Validation**: the proposed entry is validated (double‑entry, correct sign, permissible accounts).  If the confidence exceeds a threshold and the amount is below a configured cap, the journal entry is auto‑posted.  Otherwise the suggestion is queued for human review.
5. **Reconciliation**: posted entries are matched against outstanding invoices/bills and imported bank lines.  Partial payments, splits and multi‑currency transactions can be handled by extending the `BankLineLink` model.

## Balance Sheet and P&L

With all transactions funnelled into `JournalEntry` and `JournalLine`, generating a balance sheet or income statement becomes straightforward.  A report function sums debit/credit balances by account type as of a chosen date.  Equity is the sum of the retained earnings account plus current‑period profit (revenue minus expenses).  The system checks that assets equal liabilities plus equity; if not, it surfaces unbalanced journals for correction.

## Future Extensions

- **Multi‑currency support**: store both foreign and home amounts with exchange rates; compute gains/losses and translate balances at period end.
- **Accruals and deferrals**: automatically allocate revenue and expenses over time (e.g. prepaid costs, subscription revenue).
- **Anomaly detection**: use the AI engine to flag outliers or unusual spending patterns, helping to detect fraud or policy violations.
- **Bank feed import**: integrate with providers like Plaid to fetch transactions automatically and match them to invoices and bills.

The AI‑assisted accounting system is designed to evolve with your organisation’s needs.  Initially, you might set a conservative confidence threshold and manually review most suggestions.  Over time, as the model learns from your data and posting policies are refined, the system can automate a larger share of your bookkeeping work, making month‑end close much faster and more reliable.
